Project: Simple Counting Program

Step 1: Setting Up
Prompt the user for a maximum number:
Ask the user to enter a maximum number to count up to.

Step 2: Counting with a Loop
Use a while loop to count:
Ensure the user enters a positive number.
Use a for loop to count from 1 to the maximum number.

Step 3: Loop Control Statements
Incorporate loop control statements:
Use the continue statement to skip certain numbers (e.g., skip even numbers).
Use the break statement to stop counting if the user wants to exit early.
