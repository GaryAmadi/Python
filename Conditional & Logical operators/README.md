Project: Simple Loan Eligibility Checker
Objective:
Create a program that determines whether a user is eligible for a loan based on several criteria.

Instructions:
Input User Data:

Prompt the user to enter their age.
Ask for the user's monthly income.
Ask the user for their credit score.
Ask the user for the total amount of their existing debts.
Eligibility Criteria:

The user must be at least 18 years old.
The user's monthly income should be at least $2000.
The user's credit score should be at least 650.
The user's debt-to-income ratio (total debts divided by monthly income) should be less than 0.4.
Decision Making:

Use if, elif, and else statements to check each criterion.
Combine multiple conditions using logical operators (e.g., and, or).
Output:

Display a message informing the user whether they are eligible for the loan.
If not eligible, display a message explaining why (mentioning the criteria they did not meet).
